Albert Semillas is an Argentine company dedicated to selling seeds. From <a href="https://polluxcoop.com" target="_blank">Pollux</a> we offered these guys a custom made web app, using vue.js as a front-end javascript framework as well as Laravel as a back-end tool using 100% TDD (Test-Driven-Development).
